## 📖 Overview
This project visualizes stock market trends and predicts future stock prices. Users can enter any stock symbol (e.g., `GOOG`, `TSLA`, `AAPL`) to view:
1.  **Historical Data:** Closing prices from the last 10 years.
2.  **Technical Indicators:** 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Moving Averages (MA).
3.  **Prediction:** A comparison chart of the Original Price vs. the Predicted Price generated by the LSTM model.

## ✨ Features
* **Real-time Data Fetching:** Automatically downloads the latest 10 years of stock data using the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`).
* **Interactive Charts:**
    * Closing Price vs Time.
    * Closing Price vs 100-day Moving Average (MA).
    * Closing Price vs 100-day MA vs 200-day MA.
* **ML Prediction:** Uses a trained LSTM model to forecast stock prices based on the patterns of the previous 100 days.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple web UI powered by Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM layers)
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Data Source:** YFinance
